# Blossom's Roadmap

This file contains the roadmap for Blossom. As the language grows, more things will be added.

## General

- [x] (l)stat (fs module)
- [x] JSON (de)serializer
- [ ] IPC
- [ ] Develop REPL (in Blossom)
  - [ ] Requires getch() or similar (does **not** show on output; reads each char as raw byte)

## Core & Standard Library Test Cases (Repository: [cstanze/Blossom](https://github.com/cstanze/Blossom))

More to be added...

## Other

These are possible ideas, but still in debate.

- [ ] A package manager - to install various external modules/libraries from a package index
- [ ] A built-in http library - to access networking features, possibly even to write the package manager in Blossom.
