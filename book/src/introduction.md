# Introduction

Welcome to the Blossom Book! In this book, we'll discuss the basic of the language with in depth descriptions and examples.

Blossom is an interpreted, general purpose, and dynamically typed programming language. Its ease of use and simplicity allows for quick scripts and prototypes as well as larger projects.

Blossom's minimalistic design is no shortcoming. In fact, it supports common concepts such as first-class citizenship, variables, imports, functions, and structures. Blossom's main purpose is scripting and is meant to be a small language. Its compatibility with C++ allows a developer to create powerful software using Blossom. Alongside its extensibility, its performance is comparable to many mainstream languages.

This book is made to help people understand Blossom. It serves to be a "holy grail" for Blossom developers, new or old. This book also dives into many technical details of the language. Note that this book does not go over all of the standard library.
