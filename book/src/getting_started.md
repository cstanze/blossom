# Getting Started

A simple **Hello World** program can be written in Blossom in 1 line!

```bls
// hello_world.bls

println("Hello world!");
```

The `print` and `println` functions are builtin to the language, this avoids the need to import extra modules from the standard library.

To run this program, you can use the `blossom` compiler as so:

```bash
blossom hello_world.bls
```

The `blossom` compiler will run and interpret the code all in one. It should output the following to the terminal.

```txt
Hello world!
```

Congratulations! You've written a program in Blossom!
