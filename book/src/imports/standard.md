# Importing the standard lib

All langauges have a standard library. This standard library has common structures, functions, and variables to aid in everyday development. For example, Rust has a structure called `HashMap` in its standard library to act as a key-value structure. Blossom on the other hand has the `std/map` library with a similar map structure.

## The Standard Library

As you should already know, you can import modules/libraries. The standard library is split into parts to avoid needing to import the whole library. 

Here is a whole list of available `std` library parts:

- `std/bytebuffer` - Bytebuffer Type and Functions
- `std/fmt` - String Formatting Functions
- `std/fs` - File System Functions
- `std/io` - Extra IO functions
- `std/json` - JSON Encoder & Decoder
- `std/lang` - Language Types (Structs & Enums)
- `std/map` - Map Type
- `std/multiproc` - Process management
- `std/mutex` - Mutex lock type and functions
- `std/os` - Standard OS functions and variables
- `std/ptr` - Pointer type and functions
- `std/rng` - Random Number Generation
- `std/stat` - C `stat` filesystem api
- `std/str` - Helper String Functions
- `std/sys` - System Functions and Variables
- `std/term` - Minor Terminal Functions and Variables
- `std/threads` - Thread/Process management
- `std/time` - Time keeping
- `std/vec` - Vector type

This large and ever increasing list is going to prove very useful in your development.
